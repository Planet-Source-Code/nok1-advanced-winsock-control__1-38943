## \[\_Advanced Winsock Control\_\]


</div>

### Description

This control is a basic mswinsock control but with a couple changed to it. This is basicly for multi-connection management. You can toggle the acceptall to true and it will accept any incoming connection, you can also set it to function like a normal Winsock control. I also added a simple IPList function, when set to true it will accept only the IP's in the reserved IP list. Not too Complex of an idea. Votes Appreciated.
